in the found he is checking if the username exist or not . there is no benifit in doing so, because at the end we are trying to find a user;



/*
    input : userPerm, categoriePerm, 
    output: boolean 


*/

Check Permission: 
    the permission checking is related to the user so it is better to create the method inside the clsUser class
